## Say what?

Sometimes,
you want to defer
calling a function
until a certain
pre-requisite condition is met.
Other times,
you want to
call a function
repeatedly
until some post-requisite condition
is satisfied.
Occasionally,
you might even want
to do both
for the same function.

To save you writing
explicit conditions
and loops
on each of those occasions,
`tryer` implements
a predicate-based approach
that hides the cruft
behind a simple,
functional interface.

Additionally,
it allows you to easily specify
retry intervals
and limits,
so that your code
doesn't hog the CPU.
It also supports
exponential backoff
of retry intervals,
which can be useful
when handling
indefinite error states
such as network failure.

## What size is it?

5.6 kb unminified with comments, 1.1 kb minified, 0.5 kb minified + gzipped.

## How do I install it?

Via npm:

```
npm i tryer --save
```

Or if you just want the git repo:

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:philbooth/tryer.git
```

## How do I use it?

### Loading the library

If you are running in
Node.js
or another CommonJS-style
environment,
you can `require`
tryer like so:

```javascript
const tryer = require('tryer');
```

It also the supports
the AMD-style format
preferred by Require.js.

If you are
including `tryer`
with an HTML `<script>` tag,
or neither of the above environments
are detected,
it will be exported globally as `tryer`.

### Calling the exported function

`tryer` is a function
that can be invoked to
call other functions
conditionally and repeatedly,
without the need for
explicit `if` statements
or loops in your own code.
